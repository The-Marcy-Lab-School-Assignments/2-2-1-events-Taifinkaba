# Question
Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer
Event delegation is helpful for a few reason. It makes code easier to read, use, and manipulate. It also makes sure each program has 1 specific job instead of 100 things so code can be reuseable. This is more helpful because it delegating events to parent elements allows the user to make the code more flexible for future use. This way also makes it more efficient and more organized.

# Teacher Feedback

Yup! Remember that event delegation is basically when there is one event handler attached to the parent element and the parent element assigns different functionalities to its children.
