# Question
Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer
Event delegation is helpful for a few reason. It makes code easier to read, use, and manipulate. It also makes sure each program has 1 specific job instead of 100 things so code can be reuseable. This is more helpful because it delegating events to parent elements allows the user to make the code more flexible for future use. This way also makes it more efficient and more organized.

# Teacher Feedback

This is in reference to using event driven architecture but why is it more helpful for us to use a single event handler and use that on children elements?
