# Question
Why is event delegation helpful?

# Answer
Event delegation is helpful for a few reason. It makes code easier to read, use, and manipulate. It also makes sure each program has 1 specific job instead of 100 things so code can be reuseable.

# Teacher Feedback

This is in reference to using event driven architecture but why is it more helpful for us to use a single event handler and use that on children elements?
